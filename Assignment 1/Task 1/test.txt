i stand here i feel empty a class post count link href http mooshilu
i literally just text tychelle to see if she wants to hang out because reading what i just wrote about my nonexistent social life made me feel so pathetic
i really feel regretful when hearing that shinae got married to another man oh it s really sad i really hope that alex and shinae can be a couple in real life they re perfect for each other
i believed it was true love and feel devastated i wanted to settle down and have the whole marriage and kids thing with him
i feel unimportant so inadequate
i feel very low already
i feel horrible they wrote again and again personifying an act they were not the cause of it was their progeny who should be genuflecting at her the wronged woman s feet
ill just paraphrase i ranted about not being able to trust anybody and being hurt feeling rejected etc
i feel aching at all times of day
i feel so dumb when at first run through it all seems over my head amp a little too much for my struggling brain
i mention this one doesn t feel fake
im more scared of like dramas or thrillers that are actually capable of happening and so leave me feeling disturbed i
i was feeling groggy and super tired during most of the fall we ended up staying home for thanksgiving instead of making the hour trip to see jimmys family
i feel very awkward
